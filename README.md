# Linear_Infrastructure_Evaluator

This repository consists of a set of GIS tools created in ArcMap that will be used to evaluate the impacts of linear infrastructre on wildlife and biodiversity. These tools were created by Shashank Srinivasan and Tenzin Donyoe in 2016.

These tools operate by requesting a set of inputs (in .shp, .xls and .tif formats), processing them and providing the user with a single report.

Built using ArcMap's model builder, the code used for these tools has been exported to Python 2.7 format, which comprises the primary portion of this repository.
